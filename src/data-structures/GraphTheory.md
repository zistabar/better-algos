# Graph Theory

## Number of edges and nodes

`E` - number of edges

`N` - number of nodes

- `E = N - 1` → valid tree
- `E < N - 1` → not fully connected
- `E > N - 1` → cycle present

## Number in-degrees and out-degrees

- No vertex with 0 in-degrees → cycle present
- We have vertices with in-degrees that NOT equals 0 after BFS → cycle present
